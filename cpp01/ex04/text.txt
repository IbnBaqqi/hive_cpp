View controllers are rarely used in isolation. Instead, you often use multiple view controllers, each of which owns a portion of your app’s user interface.
For example, one view controller might display a table of items while a different view controller displays the selected item from that table.
Usually, only the views from one view controller are visible at a time.
A view controller may present a different view controller to display a new set of views, or it may act as a container for other view controllers’ content and animate views however it wants.

Subclassing notes
Every app contains at least one custom subclass of UIViewController. More often, apps contain many custom view controllers.
Custom view controllers define the overall behaviors of your app, including the app’s appearance and how it responds to user interactions.
The following sections provide a brief overview of some of the tasks your custom subclass performs.
